# TDD Playground

This repository serves as a playground for experimenting with different testing scenarios.

### Keep in Mind
Not every piece of code here will be realistic and this is on purpose - to avoid unnecessary complication. Also, there might not be a 100% test case coverage, which is okay at this point.

### Projects

Different scenarios will be implemented in different projects. Scenarios that are too simple to have their own separate projects will be implemented in the "Samples" project.
